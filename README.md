# BinaryFileIO

## Project Overview:

BinaryFileIO is a project aimed at providing a simple and efficient solution for reading and writing binary files. The project is primarily built using C# with a Visual Studio solution file, making it easy to integrate with your .NET applications.

With BinaryFileIO, you can efficiently handle binary files in your applications to store, retrieve and manipulate large sets of data quickly and easily. This project is designed to give developers a clear and concise API, simplifying the process of working with binary data.

## Installation Instructions:

To install BinaryFileIO, download or clone the repository to your local machine, and open the `BinaryFileIO.sln` file in Visual Studio.

Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract the contents to your desired location. Then, open Visual Studio and use the "Open a project or solution" option to open the `BinaryFileIO.sln` file.

Ensure that you have the latest version of .NET SDK installed, and build the solution to make sure all dependencies are properly resolved.

## Usage Guide:

To use BinaryFileIO in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add a reference to the BinaryFileIO project or build the DLL and reference it in your application.
2. Import the `BinaryFileIO` namespace in your code.
3. Use the provided classes and methods to read and write binary files.

Example:

```csharp
using BinaryFileIO;

// Write to a binary file
BinaryFileWriter writer = new BinaryFileWriter("path/to/output/file");
writer.WriteInt32(42);
writer.WriteSingle(3.14f);
writer.WriteUTF8String("Hello, World!");
writer.Close();

// Read from a binary file
BinaryFileReader reader = new BinaryFileReader("path/to/input/file");
int myInt = reader.ReadInt32();
float myFloat = reader.ReadSingle();
string myString = reader.ReadUTF8String();
reader.Close();
```
